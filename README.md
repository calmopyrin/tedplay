# tedplay
tedplay is media player - similar to SIDplay for the C64 - based on a stripped down Commodore plus/4 emulator for playing Commodore 264 music format files. 
Its primary format is TMF (TED Music Format) but it it also copes with the popular PSID container files originating from the Commodore 64.

You can compile it both as a command line tool using SDL2 as well as a Windows GUI program using WTL, the excellent Windows Template Library.
